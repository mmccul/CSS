# CSS
Collection of created stylesheets

All these CSS pages presume you are using Stylus to run the stylesheets.  They use some Stylus specific extensions to CSS.  Also, they are all userstyle format CSS (e.g., **foo.user.css**).

I haven't yet put in an "install to Stylus" method yet, so just copy/paste the raw CSS (or download then copy/paste) into your stylesheet maintenance program.
