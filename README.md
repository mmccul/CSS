# CSS
Collection of created stylesheets

All these CSS pages presume you are using Stylus to run the stylesheets.  They use some Stylus specific extensions to CSS.  Also, they are all userstyle format CSS (e.g., **foo.user.css**).

If you want an easy install to Stylus, open the stylesheet in question, then click the "Raw" view button.  It will open the stylesheet in Stylus and give you the option to save it.
